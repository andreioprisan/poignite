				20.	CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. <br>
				20.1. In the United States, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the DMCA) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Other protections for copyright owners are available in other jurisdictions. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Website infringe Your copyright, You (or Your agent) may send poignite a notice requesting poignite to remove the material or disable access to it. If You believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against You, please send poignite a counter-notice. In the United States, notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.copyright.gov for details). In addition, notices should include: Your contact details, the full bibliographic details of the material, the exact and full URL where You found the material, proof that You are the rights holder and a statement that, under penalty of perjury, You are the rights holder or are an authorized representative. <br>
				20.2. Upon receipt of notification the Notice and Takedown procedure is then invoked as follows: (a) poignite will acknowledge receipt of Your complaint and will make an initial assessment of the validity and plausibility of the complaint; (b) upon receipt of a valid complaint the material will be temporarily removed from the website pending an agreed solution; (c) e will contact the contributor who deposited the material, if relevant, and the contributor will be notified that the material is subject to a complaint, under what allegations, and will be encouraged to assuage the complaints concerned; (d) the complainant and the contributor will be encouraged to resolve the issue swiftly and amicably and to the satisfaction of both parties, and the material is replaced on the website unchanged or with changes, or is permanently removed. If the contributor and the complainant are unable to agree a solution, the material will remain unavailable through the Website until a time when a resolution has been reached. <br>
